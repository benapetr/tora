Installing TOra
===============

Using a binary distribution
===========================

Check the release notes for various binary distributions available of this
release. All distributions require a working Oracle client installation. This
includes the statically linked Oracle binary for Linux. Oracle 8i is the only
supported client side version (At least Oracle 8.1.5), it might work partially
with earlier or later versions of Oracle but it is as of this version not
supported (Please try and send me patches).

Installing from source
======================

Before you try to compile TOra you will need the following prerequisites:

1. A unix system which supports Qt (Dooh).
2. Qt 2.2 or later. Requires an interface compiler of at least version 3.0.
3. Oracle 8i (At least Oracle 8.1.5), it might work partially with earlier
   versions of Oracle but is as of this version not supported (Please try and
   send me patches).
4. PERL 5.
5. GNU Make.

Thats about it, you should be set to start trying.

There is a configure script available that is made to try to mimic the
behaviour of autoconf generated configure scripts. There is no need to nag
about me starting to use autoconf (See at the end for explanation).

Just issue the command "configure" and it should probably point out if you
need to issue any commands specifying locations of Qt for instance.To find
out about the options type "configure --help". TOra will compile as an KDE
application if KDE is detected by the configure script.

This will generate a Makefile.setup file that you can check if you have
troubles. It will also copy the file Makefile.orig to Makefile so you
can start compiling.

After that you should be able to compile by just issuing "make" followed
by "make install". Observe that you probably need a GNU version of make
since TOra uses GNU extensions in the makefile.

On some linux installations (SuSE specifically) you can exprience the
problem of no oracle connection showing up. Passing the --with-static-oracle
to the configure script usually fixes this problem. The problem seems to be
with the dynamic linker or some other part of binary utilities.

If you experience problems with configure
-----------------------------------------

First send a mail to (TOra <tora-develop@lists.sourceforge.net>), the TOra
development mailing list and let me know what isn't working so I can fix it
in the next version.

Then copy the file Makefile.sample to Makefile and edit it to
fill out the correct values in it.

SAP support
===========

To use SAP you need to compile SAP support for Qt which is available
from this address:

Why I'm not using autoconf
==========================

Whenever I start out using autoconf in any of my projects I end up spending
more time trying to get autoconf to work instead of time spent coding.

People tend to think that autoconf is just a strapon fix all problems
solution to configuring, but this is not the case. Especially if you
need to find Qt (Which I could have just copied), but finding Oracle is
a test I would have had to do myself and I can pretty much garantee it
would have worked worse than this solution does based on my earlier
experiences with autoconf (I'm sure it's ok if you know how to use it,
but I know perl and that works too).

Also I want a few other stuff done when you configure the metacompiling
and dependency generating etc which sets up the makefiles to need as
little work as possible to add new tools or sourcefiles to the project.
