Handle Key_Enter the same as Key_Return.
QextScintilla::foldAll() can now optionally fold all child fold points.

QextScintilla.
Vastly improved the way auto-completion and call tips work.


2006/06/25 23:51:44  phil
The default fore and background colours now default to the application palette
rather than being hardcoded to black and white.


2006/06/25 21:51:58  phil

Updated the Python lexer to add support for hightlighted identifiers and
decorators.

Fixed bug in drawing a filled rectangle without setting the pen.  This caused
the fold margin to have a border after a marker had been drawn.
