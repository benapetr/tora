Showstopper Issues before Next Release
--------------------------------------

[Petr] Completion of conversion to use QSettings

Crash if you click trashcan/delete-row on empty table in schema browser

New prefs code not saving anything? Showing dialog every time TOra opens
and not retaining default tool.

Drag and drop in schema browser to copy table cells.

Double click in schema browser causes it to interpret as 'changed' even
if no changes are made.



Minor Issues that would be nice to fix before release
-----------------------------------------------------

[Mike] Storage manager functionality

[Nathan] Proper encoding of author names in about dialog.

Seems like there is an extra column in the connection dialog, looks
weird.

Drag and drop/doubleclick in filter dialog for schema browser no longer works.



Enhancements
------------
Would love it if the Schema Browser/connection would remember the
last schema that was being browsed. In our environment, the user you connect
as never owns any objects, so if I connect as 'swconf', I'll almost always 
be browing 'swconf_owner' schema.
