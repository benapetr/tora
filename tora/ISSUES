Showstopper Issues before Next Release
--------------------------------------

CRASH - fix crash in the DB Extract tool on "Search" and/or "Compare" feature.
It looks like there is an infinite loop somewhere.

etc. etc.

Drag and drop in schema browser to copy table cells.

Double click in schema browser causes it to interpret as 'changed' even
if no changes are made.
[hit escape?]

Regulary raising warning/error dialog with:
    ORA-24374: define not done before fetch or execute and fetch
    <ERROR>SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE) FROM sys.DUAL
  propably used as "keep session alive" (?)

Clicking on either of the "sql bookmark" toolbar icons instantly crashes tora.

Batch(script) run in SQL Editor. See:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=e50db5a5f5be244c6ad03556ffd7fa76%40office.scribus.info&forum_name=tora-develop

Minimize sf.net error backlog - bugtracker.

Walk through basic tasks and dialogs and test its functionality. (create table, drop, alter etc.)

"Waiting..." shows up in right pane in schema browser until you click on a table name also stays up if no tables in schema.

">|" arrow on schema browser view just scrolls to bottom of display instead of reading all rows as it used to.

Error warning dialogs are modal, and have to be closed in the right order. Ideally - would like to see the error popups
be a single window, something in the style of the javascript error console in firefox perhaps?

MySQL: numerous crashes in schema browser - running under gdb hides a lot of these unfortunately... has been stable

Oracle: error "result should be 18 in segment attributes was 2" in toExtract on Script tab

Row number in first column of schema browser for 'Data' tab - needs to resize to fit contents - right now, it truncates.

Goofy "hostname" field in new connection dialog. With a mix of mysql and
oracle, get some strange values populating the oracle hostname field. Would
prefer something like just forcing hostname to "TNS" for Oracle TNS entries.


Minor Issues that would be nice to fix before release
-----------------------------------------------------

[Nathan] Proper encoding of author names in about dialog.

Would be nice to be able to specify/store a default schema with the db
connection. 

Drag and drop/doubleclick in filter dialog for schema browser no longer works.

MySQL: Lots of "database not open" warning msgs 

Oracle: better handling on extents tab if no access to dba_extents view. 



Enhancements
------------
[needs work] Would love it if the Schema Browser/connection would remember the
last schema that was being browsed. In our environment, the user you connect
as never owns any objects, so if I connect as 'swconf', I'll almost always 
be browing 'swconf_owner' schema.


Resolved Issues
---------------

[FIXED] Explain Plan shortcut prints to stdout:
QAction::eventFilter: Ambiguous shortcut overload: F3
    - explain plan mode uses F6 now. F3 (search next) is working again.

[Mike] Storage manager functionality

[DONE - some issues can be found by testing of course] [Petr] Completion of conversion to use QSettings

[FIXED] Seems like there is an extra column in the connection dialog, looks
weird.

[FIXED] New prefs code not saving anything? Showing dialog every time TOra opens
and not retaining default tool.

[good enough] 11g compatibility
- mostly works fine but should have a compile option
(not use 10g). several sql queries need to be tweeked, tora locks up
when cache runs.

[probably unrelated noblock crash that should be fixed by toeventquery]
Crash if you click trashcan/delete-row on empty table in schema browser
[mrj: can't reproduce this, can you send me a stacktrace? the code
does the right thing it appears.] [nneul: nor can I now... weird... will
leave this in for a little bit, if it returns, I'll get you a trace]

[RESOLVED] Single clicking in sql editor entry area if entire text is selected causes
the selected text to be pasted at the end of the entry area as if you
middle-clicked. Picture normal behavior of selecting it all to copy it, then
single clicking to unselect it and move to something else...
