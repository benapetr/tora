Showstopper Issues before Next Release
--------------------------------------

[Petr] Completion of conversion to use QSettings

Crash if you click trashcan/delete-row on empty table in schema browser

Drag and drop in schema browser to copy table cells.

Double click in schema browser causes it to interpret as 'changed' even
if no changes are made.

Regulary raising warning/error dialog with:
    ORA-24374: define not done before fetch or execute and fetch
    <ERROR>SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE) FROM sys.DUAL
  propably used as "keep session alive" (?)

Explain Plan shortcut prints to stdout:
QAction::eventFilter: Ambiguous shortcut overload: F3

Single clicking in sql editor entry area if entire text is selected causes
the selected text to be pasted at the end of the entry area as if you
middle-clicked. Picture normal behavior of selecting it all to copy it, then
single clicking to unselect it and move to something else... 

Clicking on either of the "sql bookmark" toolbar icons instantly crashes tora.


Minor Issues that would be nice to fix before release
-----------------------------------------------------

[Mike] Storage manager functionality

[Nathan] Proper encoding of author names in about dialog.

Drag and drop/doubleclick in filter dialog for schema browser no longer works.



Enhancements
------------
Would love it if the Schema Browser/connection would remember the
last schema that was being browsed. In our environment, the user you connect
as never owns any objects, so if I connect as 'swconf', I'll almost always 
be browing 'swconf_owner' schema.


Resolved Issues
---------------
[FIXED] Seems like there is an extra column in the connection dialog, looks
weird.

[FIXED] New prefs code not saving anything? Showing dialog every time TOra opens
and not retaining default tool.
