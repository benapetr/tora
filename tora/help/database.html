<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Initial rows to fetch in query</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This setting indicates how many rows to always fetch from a query when executing it.
Observe that you can always read more from the individual query just by scrolling down. Check
the <B>All</B> checkbox to always read all the lines. Be aware that TOra will interact sluggishly
or not at all while reading many lines. It will also keep the entire result in memory so checking
the <B>All</B> box and reading a really large box could bring your machine to it's knees.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Maximum column size</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The maximum size of a column to read. If a column contains data that is larger than this
value the query will fail. Don't set this too low.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Maximum size display</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The maximum width a list column will get automatically regardless of how large the content
is. This is so you can still see the rest of the columns even if one of the first can contain
very large values. You can always resize the column by hand afterwards.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Autocommit changes</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>If this is set any changes made to the database will be automatically commited
as soon as you make them. Use this with care, the transaction handling is there for a reason
you know.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Checkpoint name</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This is a checkpoint TOra should use when it is making changes that need to be roll backed.
One place where this is used is to perform explain plans without filling up the plan table. The
name doesn't matter, just make sure you don't use this checkpoint name yourself.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Default date format</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The format that you prefer dates to be displayed. Changing this will require a reconnect to
the database before it starts to operate. The string should be a standard Oracle date to string
conversion specification. For more information see the Oracle SQL Reference.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Explain plan table</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The table to use to temporarily store explained execution plans. Use the <B>Create Table</B>
button to create the table if you don't have it.
