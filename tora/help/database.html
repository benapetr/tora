<H1>Database Settings</H1>
This page of the options contain settings on how to interact with the database.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/database.png><P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Autocommit changes</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>If this is set any changes made to the database will be automatically committed
as soon as you make them. Use this with care, the transaction handling is there for a reason
you know.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Initial rows to fetch in query</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This setting indicates how many rows to always fetch from a query when executing it.
Observe that you can always read more from the individual query just by scrolling down. Check
the <B>All</B> checkbox to always read all available records. Be aware that TOra will interact sluggishly
or not at all while reading many lines. It will also keep the entire result in memory so checking
the <B>All</B> box and reading a really large table could bring your machine to it's knees.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Don't reread data if query is exactly same.</B>
</TR></TD>If checked TOra will not refresh a query if it is reexecuted exactly the same two times in a row.
This is mainly usefull in the schema browser when you have a slow connection and need to switch between
tabs a lot.
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Maximum size display</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The maximum width a list column will get automatically regardless of how large the content
is. This is so you can still see the rest of the columns even if one of the first can contain
very large values. You can always resize the column by hand afterwards.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
There may also be pages under this for each individual database provider. Currently onlye Oracle uses
this feature. That setup looks like this.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/oracle.png>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Checkpoint name</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This is a checkpoint TOra should use when it is making changes that need to be rolled back.
One place where this is used is to perform explain plans without filling up the plan table. The
name doesn't matter, just make sure you don't use this checkpoint name yourself.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Default date format</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The format that you prefer dates to be displayed. Changing this will require a reconnect to
the database before it starts to operate. The string should be a standard Oracle date to string
conversion specification. For more information see the Oracle SQL Reference.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Explain plan table</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The table to use to temporarily store explained execution plans. Use the <B>Create Table</B>
button to create the table if you don't have it.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Statement cache size</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Indicate the number of open statement handles TOra can keep while it is running. This will reduce
statement parsing needed when TOra extracts information from the database.
