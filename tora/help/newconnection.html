<H1>Connecting to a database</H1>
You can connect to a database by selecting the <B>File|New Connection</B> menu entry or
the toolbar button. For more information about the menu and toolbar see
<A HREF=window.html>this page</A>.<P>
After selecting the menu you will be presented with the following dialog.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/newconnection.png><P>
The filling out of this dialog is pretty straight forward.
<TABLE>
<H1>Connecting to a database</H1>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Username</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The username with which to connect to the database</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Password</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The password to use for the connection, this defaults to
manager. You can also configure TOra to remember your last used password in
the <A HREF=preferences.html>options dialog</A>.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Use SQL*Net</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This is perhaps the most difficult setting. This indicates wether
to connect locally to the database or use SQL*Net. If you check this box the
connection is made through the Oracle listener, otherwise a local connection
usually using shared memory or named pipes is made.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Database</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>What database to connect to, the listbox is prefilled with the
values available in your tnsnames.ora file.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Connection Mode</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The type of connection to make, usually normally always suffices here.
But sometimes using database administration SYS_DBA or SYS_OPER is needed. If you
don't know what these mean you probably shouldn't be using them.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
Upon establishing a successfull connection all the settings of the dialog will be saved
and remembered when the next connection is made with the exception of the password.
