<H1>Connecting to a database</H1>
You can connect to a database by selecting the <B>File|New Connection</B> menu entry or
the toolbar button. For more information about the menu and toolbar see
<A HREF=window.html>this page</A>.<P>
After selecting the menu you will be presented with the following dialog.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/newconnection.png><P>
The filling out of this dialog is pretty straight forward.
<TABLE>
<H1>Connecting to a database</H1>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Username</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The username with which to connect to the database</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Password</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The password to use for the connection, this defaults to
manager. You can also configure TOra to remember your last used password in
the <A HREF=preferences.html#global>options dialog</A>.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Use SQL*Net</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This is perhaps the most difficult setting. This indicates wether
to connect locally to the database or use SQL*Net. If you check this box the
connection is made through the Oracle listener, otherwise a local connection
usually using shared memory or named pipes is made.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Database</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>What database to connect to, the listbox is prefilled with the
values available in your tnsnames.ora file.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Connection Mode</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The type of connection to make, usually normally always suffices here.
But sometimes using database administration SYS_DBA or SYS_OPER is needed. If you
don't know what these mean you probably shouldn't be using them.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
Upon establishing a successfull connection all the settings of the dialog will be saved
and remembered when the next connection is made with the exception of the password.<P>
<A NAME=priv><H2>What priveledges do you need to run TOra</H2>
TOra should be able to run as any user, although off course you can never do anything
in TOra that aren't allowed from that Oracle account. You will be able to use pretty much
any tool in TOra for read only purposes if you are granted the <B>SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE</B>,
also some parts of TOra will have limited functionality if you do not have the
<B>ALTER SESSION</B> priviledge.<P>
Also you need to be able to create the plan table if that is not done for you. The plan
table (See <A HREF=database.html>options</A> for how to select plan table name) must
also be available with <B>INSERT</B> and <B>SELECT</B> access. TOra will function without
the plan table but off course you will not be able to display an execution plans.
