</TABLE><P>
<A NAME=priv><H2>Defining privileges</H2>
All roles, system or object privileges are defined using basically the same interface.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/priviledges.png><P>
This list contains a tree view with first the schema, then the type, the object and finally
the actual privilege to define. In the system or role tabs, the privileges are in the
root of the list. If you open the privilege you will find an additional <B>admin</B> item
which if checked will give the user or role the ability to grant the privilege on to other
users or roles. In the role case you also have another child item to the privilege which is
<B>default</B>. If <B>default</B> is checked the role will be enabled by default when the
user logs in. When you start a new user all checked items will be made visible by expanding the
parent items.<P>
<A NAME=quota><H2>Defining quota</H2>
You define quotas using the following interface.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/quota.png><P>
To change a quota simply select the tablespace and specify the new quota using the radio buttons
at the end of the screen. If <B>value</B> is selected you can specify a value using the size
control at the bottom.
