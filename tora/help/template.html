<H1>Template Help</H1>
This tool provides help for writing PL/SQL and SQL queries by allowing a non obtrusive
database browser and help lookup.<P>
The template help is implemented as a docked window if these are available. They are available
in Qt 3.0 (Released only as beta as of 2001-07-11) and KDE.<P>
The help browser are divided into two panes. The top pane displays a tree view of the available
documentation. The lower is used to display information about the selected item in the top pane
and it's content may differ depending on what is selected.<P>
The top pane is in the default distribution divided into two parts as well. The 
<A HREF=template.html#browser>DB Browser</A></B> which lets you explore your connected
databases through a tree structure. The second part is a plain tree list of available text
documentation. By default only one manual is supplied which contain PL/SQL functions, but
an <A HREF=template.html#editor>editor</A> is supplied to write more help.<P>
