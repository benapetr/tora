<H1>History of TOra</H1>
I started the TOra project in december 2000, the reason being that I had been increasingly jelous of the
tools available for interactive with Oracle databases to my colleges using windows. The tools that were
available were not nearly powerful enough. Execution plans being pretty much the most advanced feature
available. During this time I also made a lot of attempts to get VMWare to work without any success
fortunately, if I could have made this to work I would never have started TOra but run a VMWare client
with Windows.
<P>
I started by working on what is now the worksheet in Oracle, already in the beginning I envisaged TOra
being plugin based and easily extendable with new functionality without any or much change of the
existing codebase, the toTool class being one of the first written gives exactly this functionality.<P>
In the beginning the developement pace was really fast and it didn't take long before it had at least
in my oppinion surpassed any available tool for Linux as an SQL worksheet. Most of the developement of
these versions were made in airports in Asia since I spent about a week in those on a backpacking
holliday there around new years 2000 to 2001. Yes, I there aren't many other people who would bring a
laptop on a backpacking vacation, but I knew I would be spending a lot of time in airports and what better
way to waste the time.
<P>
By the time I was back I released the first version of TOra with both worksheet and database browser. By
this time I started looking at the PL/SQL debugging package available in Oracle, this was the first time
I looked at developing functionality in TOra that I didn't really feel a pressing need for myself since
I rarely write any large PL/SQL code. This was released in version 0.4 at the end of January, still only
about 1 month after the project was started. This was the first functionality in TOra that is not available
from any other open source project.
<P>
The next big thing to happen to this project was that TrollTech released the first version of Qt Free for
windows at which point I started glancing at making TOra available for the windows platform. I've made a
few feeble attempts earlier using an evaluation copy of Qt/Windows without much success. But when this
release was made I really sat down and wen't through it finding lots of problems mainly with regards to
Visual C++ (Which is really crap, but the one you have to use if you want to use Qt Free).
<P>
<H1>The future</H1>
At this time developement on the next release of TOra is already well under way and will feature improved
tuning and DBA capabilities as well as a new database API with support for other databases than Oracle.
Also on the menu is support for more architectures, specifically HP/UX and Solaris. The most requested
features by users are also either already implemented or on their way to be implemented. These include
such things as a filter in the content editor, a busy cursor to indicate when TOra is accessing the
database, code completion in the editors and ability to alter objects in the database browser.
