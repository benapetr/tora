To access the options of TOra you select the <B>Edit|Options</B> menu item, you will then be
presented with the following dialog.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/preferences.png><P>
In windows preferences are stored in the registry, but in Linux it is stored in a file
called <I>.torarc</I> in the users home directory. If this file doesn't exist a file called
<I>/etc/torarc</I> is used if it exists.
<H2>Selecting page</H2>
To the left is a list containing the available option pages you can display.<P>

until <B>OK</B> is pressed. You can always discard any changes made by pressing the escape
key or the <B>Cancel</B> button.<P>

These may vary some depending on how your system was compiled and configured. Not all options

will be replaced by your home directory on UNIX or documents directory in Windows.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Help directory</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Should point to where the TOra help table of contents file is stored (toc.htm). This
should be set up correctly if you made a normal install.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Plugin directory</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This option is only available in a plugin based TOra installation. It should point
to the directory where the plugins for TOra are located. It should be set up
correctly on installation if needed.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Cache directory</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Should point to where the TOra Disk Cache files are stored. There is one file for each 
Connection. 
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Change current connection with active window</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>If this option is set, changing the current window will also change the current
connection to that of the active window. The connection is only changed when you change window
so if you want to change the connection to something else you can still do so as long as you
don't change the window.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Save last password</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Whether or not TOra should store the last password used to connect. <B>Be aware that the
password is store in clear text in either the windows registry or a file.</B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Include DB in caption</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>If this is set the database name will be included in the caption of all your tool
windows after the tool name. Observe that there often is no other way of knowing which
database the window works on except for this.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Maximize window on start</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>If this is checked the TOra main window will open maximized on startup.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Desktop Aware</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Set this if Qt should try to figure out and interact nicely with the desktop environment.
The reason for this switch is that in some versions of KDE TOra doesn't look nice if this is
checked. This switch is only available for Qt only applications.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>use Disk Cache</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This option tells TOra to Cache the Object List in the Cache Directory. Default is No Caching. When
Caching is activated, you have to refresh the object cache with the menu option File->Reread Object Cache, because,
the default source for the Object List is the diskfile.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Antialias fonts</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Check this if you want TOra to use antialiased fonts in X11 if available. This option

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Docks use toolbars</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This option tells TOra how to emulate docked windows when they are not available. Docked
windows are not available if you do not use KDE and have a Qt version less than 3 (If you
run in windows you're it). If this is checked docks will be emulated with a toolbar, this has the
drawback that you can't resize them. If unchecked docks appear in normal windows.

work.

smaller and still be readable. Given as a fraction where 0.5 means half the size on paper and 1.0
the same size.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
