The rest of the settings are tool specific and covered under corresponding tool in the 
<A HREF=tools.html>tools section</A>.<P>
Selecting a page does not discard the changes of another page, and no changes are saved
until <B>Ok</B> is pressed. You can always discard any changes made by pressing the escape
key or the <B>Cancel</B> button.<P>
<A NAME=global><H2>Global Settings</H2>
These may vary some depending on how your system was compiled and configured. Not all options
are displayed in the screenshot since that was made on a KDE version of TOra.<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Custom SQL</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>
The file in which to store your custom SQL. For more information about custom SQL see
the <A HREF=sqledit.html>SQL Editor tool</A>. The string <B>$HOME</B> will be
replaced by your home directory on unix or documents directory in Windows.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Help directory</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Should point to where the TOra help table of contents file is stored (toc.htm). This
should be set up correctly if you made a normal install.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Plugin directory</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This option is only available in a plugin based TOra installation. It should point
to the directory where the plugins for TOra are located. It should be set up
correctly on installation if needed.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Save last password</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Wether or not TOra should store the last password used to connect. <B>Be aware that the
password is store in clear text in either the windows registry or a file on windows.</B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Long sessions</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This tells TOra that it can open new connections to the database when it thinks there
may be a considerable delay in the response. If you don't check this TOra will hang if you
execute a long running query in the SQL worksheet. It is disabled by default since this is
the nice thing to do with regards to the database. In windows you can not abort running queries
due to a limitation in its thread implementation.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Include DB in caption</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>If this is set the database name will be included in the caption of all your tool
windows after the tool name. Observe that there often is no other way of knowing which
database the window works on except for this.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Desktop Aware</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Set this if Qt should try to figure out and interact nicely with the desktop environment.
The reason for this switch is that in some versions of KDE TOra doesn't look nice if this is
set. This switch is only available for Qt only applications.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Antialias fonts</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Check this if you wan't TOra to use antialiased fonts in X11 if available. This option
may not be available (Regardless of if you have access to antialiased fonts or not), it
is a compile time option.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Docks use toolbars</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This option tells TOra how to emulate docked windows when they are not available. Docked
windows are not available if you do not use KDE and have a Qt version less than 3 (If you
run in windows you are it). If checked docks will be emulated with a toolbar, this has the
drawback that you can't resive them. If unchecked docks appear in normal windows.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Table scale</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This is the scale which to use when printing lists. Lists on paper can usually be a little
smaller and still be readable. Given as a fraction where 0.5 means half as small on paper and 1.0
the same size.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Status message</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The number of seconds to display error messages in the status bar. If you specify 0
they are kept until the next message is displayed.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Message history</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The number of status messages to store in the status message history before
the oldest are removed when new are added.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Size Unit</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The unit to display sizes in TOra.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Refresh</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The default refresh time to use in TOra. Tools which autoupdate use this setting as the
default. It can also be changed on a per tool basis.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Style</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>The style which the TOra GUI should use. This is only available as a compile time option
for Qt only based TOra.
