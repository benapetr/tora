<H1>Elements of the main window</H1>
The main window in TOra has the following elements as shown below. It is assumes you know how
to handle a normal windows interface and no explanation about how to press buttons, select
menus will be presented. If you are administrating Oracle you probably know how to handle a
mouse.<P>

If you've ever used a windows program you will recognize most of the menus hopefully.<P>

</TABLE>
<H2>Tools</H2>
The buttons in this section can vary depending on which plugins were loaded at startup,
they are described in the <A HREF=tools.html>tools section</A> of the help. What is notable
here is that when a button is pressed it is started for the currently selected connection
available at the end of the application toolbar.
<A NAME=connection><H2>Connection management</H2>
All the buttons in this section have one thing in common. Except for the new connection they
all operate on the currently selected connection. The currently open connections are available
in a drop down list at the right of the toolbar. The selected item in this list is the connection
that new tools will be working on and also any commit, rollback or close connection command.<P>
The numbers behind the actual connection is the version of the Oracle server that this connection
is made to.<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>New connection</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This will pop up the <A HREF=newconnection.html>new connection</A> dialog which is used
to open new connections to oracle.</A>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Close connection</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Will close the current connection to Oracle. If uncommitted data exists it will also ask
if you want to commit or rollback the changes. Observe that any tools associated with this
connection will also be closed when closing a connection.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Commit connection</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Commit the changes currently made to the database.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Rollback connection</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Rollback any changes made in the current connection.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<H1>Other items in the workspace</H1>
There are a few other items on the workspace that are worth taking notice of.
<H2>Statusbar</H2>
This will display any messages that TOra need to inform the user of. TOra generally
takes the path of not bothering the user with pop ups when something goes wrong, but
simply display it in the statusbar. So if something isn't working, make sure you
check the statusbar if something went wrong.<P>
There is an up button available to the right of the toolbar which when pressed can display
a history of the contents of the status bar. This is also useful since the statusbar usually
clears after certain amount of time but the information is always available here. Both the
time until a message disappears and the amount of backlog to keep is configurable from the
<A HREF=preferences.html#global>option</A> dialog. If you select an item in the popup menu
the contents of the entry will be opened in a <A HREF=common.html#memo>memo editor</A>
where you can read them more easily and also copy the text more easily.<P>
Next to the right is the coordinates of the editor that currently has the focus.<P>
Fursthest to the right is swirling logo which will move whenever TOra is doing something in
the background to indicate that the database is still busy performing some kind of operation
in the background.<P>
<H2>Tool windows</H2>
These are the tools that actually let you interact with Oracle. For more information check out
the <A HREF=tools.html>tools section</A> of the help. One thing to note about tool windows is
that if the caption ends with a &lt; <code>digit</code> &gt; this is the digit that you can use
together with the control modifier to select this window.
<H2>Workspace</H2>
The part of the main window that contain the tool windows.
<H2>Editors</H2>
For more information about key bindings etc. in editors check out the
<A HREF=editors.html>dedicated section</A>.
<H2>Result List</H2>
These mean every kind of list displayed in TOra. For information about
how to interact with these check out the <A HREF=lists.html>dedicated section</A>.
<H2>Charts</H2>
Used to visualize data, usually some kind of database statistics. There are no charts in the
example window above and they are described in a <A HREF=charts.html>dedicated section</A>.
<A NAME=object>
<H2>Object Cache</H2>
When TOra opens a new connection to a database the database connected to is queried for all
its objects and the synonyms available. This data is then used in most places when lists of
objects are displayed. The thing to understand is that this data is cached so that any objects
modified during the connection will not be visible unless you clear the cache and reread it
from the database. As long as the object cache is read you can see the <B>background activity</B>
swirling in the right part of the status bar.
