<H1>Elements of the main window</H1>
The main window in TOra has the following elemts as shown below. It is assumes you know how
to handle a normal windows interface and no explanation about how to press buttons, select
menues will be presented. If you are administration Oracle you probably know how to handle a
mouse.<P>

</TABLE>
<H2>Tools</H2>
The buttons in this section can vary depending on which plugins were loaded at startup,
they are described in the <A HREF=tools.html>tools section</A> of the help. What is notable
here is that when a button is pressed it is started for the currently selected connection
available at the end of the application toolbar.
<A NAME=connection><H2>Connection management</H2>
All the buttons in this section have one thing in common. Except for the new connection they
all operate on the currently selected connection. The currently open connections are available
in a drop down list at the right of the toolbar. The selected item in this list is the connection
that new tools will be working on and also any commit, rollback or close connection command.<P>
The numbers behind the actual connection is the version of the Oracle server that this connection
is made to.<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>New connection</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This will pop up the <A HREF=newconnection.html>new connection</A> dialog which is used
to open new connections to oracle.</A>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Close connection</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Will close the current connection to Oracle. If uncommited data exists it will also ask
if you want to commit or rollback the changes. Observe that any tools associated with this
connection will also be closed when closing a connection.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Commit connection</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Commit the changes currently made to the database.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Rollback connection</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Rollback any changes made in the current connection.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<H1>Other items in the workspace</H1>
There are a few other items on the workspace that are worth taking notice of.
<H2>Statusbar</H2>
This will display any messages that TOra need to inform the user of. TOra generally
takes the path of not bothering the user with popups when something goes wrong, but
simply displays it in the statusbar. So if something isn't working, make sure you
check the statusbar if something went wrong.<P>
There is an up button available to the right of the toolbar which when pressed can display
a history of the contents of the status bar. This is also usefull since the statusbar usually
clears after certain amount of time but the information is always available here. Both the
time until a message disapears and the amount of backlog to keep is configarable from the
<A HREF=preferences.html#global>option</A> dialog.
Furthest to the right is the current coordinates of
the editor that currently has the focus.<P>
<H2>Tool windows</H2>
These are the tools that actually let you interact with Oracle. For more information check out
the <A HREF=tools.html>tools section</A> of the help. One thing to note about tool windows is
that if the caption ends with a &lt; <code>digit</code> &gt; this is the digit that you can use
together with the control modifier to select this window.
<H2>Workspace</H2>
The part of the main window that contain the tool windows.
<H2>Editors</H2>
For more information about key bindings etc in editors check out the
<A HREF=editors.html>dedicated section</A>.
<H2>Result List</H2>
These mean every kind of list displayed in TOra. For information about
how to interact with these check out the <A HREF=lists.html>dedicated section</A>.
