<H1>Other common elements</H1>
These describe other elements that are used in several parts of the user interface.<P>
<A NAME=sga><H2>SGA Statement</H2>
This element is used to describe an element in the SGA.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/sgastatement.png><P>
The SGA statement have three tabs. The first tab called <B>SQL</B> simply display all of the SQL of the statement.
The second tab called <B>Execution plan</B> displays the execution plan of the statement. This is described in more
detail later. The last tab called <B>Information</B> simply display the information available about the statement
in the SGA.<P>
<A NAME=explain><H2>Explain plan</H2>
This element can be either part of an SGA statement or by itself in some cases. For more information about
execution paths check the Oracle manual Designing and Tuning for Performance, chapter 5 in the 8i release.<P>
A few notes here is that the execution plan displayed here is not necessarily the same as when run depending
on one of these reasons.<P>
<UL>
<LI>It is run as a different user which doesn't access the same database objects as the user you are logged in as now.
<LI>The session running the query can have changed some optimizer parameters compared to your session.
</UL><P>
What you see in this window is the execution you would get if you ran the statement like the one you are logged in
as now and in your session.<P>
Explain plan requires a table to store the result in. The name of this table can be configured in the <A HREF=database.html>options</A>.
If the table doesn't exist TOra will ask you if it should try to create it. Without this table you can not display execution plans
in TOra.<P>
<A NAME=param><H2>Getting bind parameters</H2>
This dialog is displayed when input parameters are required to run the SQL. For instance the example dialog is the dialog displayed
when running the following SQL in the worksheet.<P>
<table width=100% border=0><tr><td bgcolor="#BEEAE0">
<pre>
select * from essprc where prcid > :prcid and begrdt > :begrdt;
</pre></td></tr></table><P>
<IMG SRC=images/getparam.png><P>
As you can see the field name as specified after the : character is presented as a title. If the same field name is used at
several parts of the query you only get to specify it once. You specify the value in the editor line just to the right of the
field name label. If you want to specify a NULL value check the <B>NULL</B> checkbox to the right of the editor.<P>
The parameter editor will cache it's value so it will remember the last parameters you fed to it when you run the query again.
<A NAME=describe><H2>Object description</H2>
This is a list that describes the columns of a table or view. There is nothing much special
about this view except that you can check the collected analyze statistics for the column by
placing the cursor over it and reading the tooltip that will be displayed. If no tooltip
is displayed there is no analyzed statistics available.
