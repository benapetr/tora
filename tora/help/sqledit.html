<H1>SQL Editor</H1>
When TOra needs to run an SQL statement to it will not actually use the SQL needed directly.
It will fetch an SQL statement by addressing it with a string. The string is built up by a
module name, followed by a colon and a unique name for the SQL (Example: toBrowser:ListIndex
which will contain the SQL statement for getting all the indexes).<P>
For each SQL name there may be a number of actual SQL strings that are available, each are
associated with a version number. When TOra requests an SQL statement by a name it will
receive the string with the statement with the highest version number lower than the current
connection that will be used to run it. Each SQL name also has a description associated with it
so you can understand what the SQL is supposed to do.<P>
TOra has a default SQL name to statement map which can be redefined by the user to either
add support for different versions than TOra originally supports, or change the default
behaviour for TOra in some cases. The changes from the default map is saved in the file
defined in the <A HREF=preferences.html#global>options</A> dialog. If you make changes to
improve support for other versions of Oracle please send this file to
<A HREF=mailto:tora@henrik.org>tora@henrik.org</A> and we will incorporate them in the future
releases.<P>
You start the SQL editor either by selecting <B>Edit|Edit SQL</B> or by selecting <B>Edit SQL</B>
in the result list context editor. You are then presented with the following dialog.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/sqledit.png><P>
The window is divided into several parts. To the left is a list of SQL statements available
divided into modules. When an item is selected in this list you can use the right part of the
screen to modify the SQL associated by the selected name.<P>
The right part of the window is divided into the name and version at the top. Each statement
name can have several versions of an SQL. You can add a new version by simply entering a new
text into the version combobox. You can also select any of the existing version by selecting
them from the list.<P>
Below the name and version is the description which is independent from the version. Below
that is a <A HREF=worksheet.html>worksheet</A> which you can use to edit and testrun the
SQL statement that should be associated with the given name and version.<P>
There is also a toolbar with the current available commands.<P>
