<H1>Using the help browser</H1>
You can always bring up help on the current dialog etc by pressing the <B>F1</B> key. You can also select it from the application
menubar under Help (dooh).<P>
When you open the help browser which you obviously have done. You are presented with a screen similar to the following.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/help.png><P>
On the top of the screen is a toolbar with back and forward buttons that you can use to back and forward in the history
of viewed pages that you have previously looked at. This list kept as long as TOra isn't restarted. However when you
display help in dialogboxes that help is not added to the main application help history.<P>
To the right is a large area which displays the documentation, this is essentially a web browser (If you run the KDE
version it is actually an embedded konqueror) and works as such, clicking on blue text will go to the referenced
section.<P>
To the right is a pane that can either display the contents of the manuals available for browsing. Note that the
tora help is compatible with Oracle manuals which can be browsed in the help viewer if you add them in the
<A HREF=additionalhelp.html>options dialog</A> under "Additional help".<P>
You can also display a different pane where you can search the manuals. In this version of TOra you can only
search external Oracle manuals and not the TOra user manual. This will probably be fixed in later versions.<P>
Just enter the words you want to find and the sections containing <B>all</B> the words entered will
be displayed in the list below it. Selecting a row in either the search result or contents list will bring
up that page in the right part of the screen.
