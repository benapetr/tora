<TD VALIGN=top>This is a quick way to add a collection of manuals. When you pop this up
it will ask you for a filename. In Oracle 8 this should be the index page that contains
the links to the manuals. Observe that this is not the page which links to the different
book cateries. In Oracle 9i you should point it to the docindex.htm file in the base
directory of the documentation. If successfull all the manuals available on the page
is added to the list of manuals.</TD></TR>
