<H2>Elements of the debugger window</H2>
On the top of the screen is the <A HREF=debugger.html#toolbar>toolbar</A> for the debugger.<P>
Below that to the right are two panes. The top one <B>Objects</B> contains the available objects
in the selected schema. The schema is selectable through the <A HREF=debugger.html>schema</A>.
Select the code object you want to debug or edit in this list or start a new object before
starting to edit the code.<P>
The lower pane <B>Contents</B> contains the structure of the selected object. Here you can
find declared methods of packages and also variables or even anonymous blocks in your code.
Selecting a line in this pane will move the cursor to where the element is in your code, for
