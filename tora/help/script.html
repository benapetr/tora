<H2>Defining the operation</H2>
The first thing to select is if you want to <B>extract</B> script to recreate an object or to <B>compare</B>. You choose
this by selecting one of the two radio buttons to the left of the screen.<P>
Next you should indicate what kind of information you want included in the extract or compare. This is selected with the
checkboxes just to the right of the mode selection. Depending on the mode some options may be
disabled.<P>

This specifies the schema to be used when extracting. If you select <B>Same</B>, the same
schema as the source database is used. If you select <B>None</B>, no schema is generated.
Specifying anything else will replace the source schema with the one entered here.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE><P>
If you specify the <B>extract</B> mode you can also indicate a way to resize generated
storage specifications. This could be usefull to make a database have only a few standard
storage specifications making less prone to fragmentation.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/resize.png><P>
You have three modes to specify how resizing should work. First there is <B>Don't resize</B>
which means leave the same as the original. Then there is <B>Auto resize</B> which should
work for pretty much everyone. In this a resize specification for each order of magnitude of
size is given a specific storage specication. And last is the <B>Custom resize</B> mode in
which you specify how to transform the storage specifications to new values.<P>
