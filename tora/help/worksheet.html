<H1>SQL Worksheet</H1>
This tool provides a way to execute arbitrary SQL or PL/SQL code and also investigate how it is execute and it's resource consumtion.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/worksheet.png><P>
The worksheet is split into two panes. The upper one is the editor where you enter the queries you want to run. In the lower you can
investigate the result.
<H2>Toolbar &amp; menu</H2>
There is a toolbar and a toolmenu available for the worksheet. They both contain the following commands.<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Execute Current</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This executes the statement you current are in or after. When the statement is executed
the statement executed will be highlighted in the editor. The keyboard shortcut is <B>CTRL-Return</B>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Execute All</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Execute all the statements in the editor. You get no result from the execution, the
statement is simply executed. You can investigate the success of the commands in the <B>Logging</B>
pane of the result. The keyboard shortcut is <B>F8</B>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Execute Next</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This does exactly the same as the <B>execute current</B> command with one difference.
If the cursor is after the last ; of the statement and before the first non whitespace character
of the next statenebt this command will execute the next statement when
the other command will execute the previous statement. The keyboard shortcut is <B>F9</B>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Refresh</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>This will re-execute the last executed statement. The
keyboard shortcut is <B>F5</B>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Commit</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Commit the changes of the database connection that this worksheet is connected to. The
keyboard shortcut is <B>F2</B>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Rollback</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Rollback the changes of the database connection that this worksheet is connected to. The
keyboard shortcut is <B>CTRL+Backspace</B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Enable Statistics</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Enable or disable collecting statistics when running the statements. This will cause
TOra to execute at least two extra queries for every statement executed when enabled.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Stop execution</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>Abort execution of the currently running query. This will not work in Windows where
TOra will hang until the first row of the statement is returned or the statement is finnished. When
you execute a new statement the current execution will be aborted.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Erase Log</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top>
Erase the contents of the rows under the <B>Logging</B> pane of the result.</TD></TR>
</TABLE><P>
<H2>Using the worksheet editor</H2>
TOra uses a ; to separate statements in the same way as SQL*Plus. One difference is that TOra doesn't
count whitespaces in any way to separate statements. You could write several statements on the same
row and it wouldn't be a problem.<P>
Another difference to SQL*Plus is that TOra parses the SQL you write to determine if you are within
a PL/SQL block. If that is the case the entire block will be executed. This feature can be enabled
or disabled in the <A HREF=worksheet.html#preferences>options</A>.<P>
<table width=100% border=0><tr><td bgcolor="#BEEAE0">
<pre>
SELECT * FROM dual; SELECT * FROM all_tables;

BEGIN
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello');
END;
</pre></td></tr></table><P>
In the example above there are three statements that TOra will recognise and execute.<P>
There are a few words that are treated as comments for compatibility with SQL*Plus scripts. They are
<B>--</B>, <B>REM</B>, <B>PROMPT</B> and <B>SET</B>. Comments will disregard whatever is to the right on
the line.<P>
You can also use bind variables in the worksheet by using the normal <B>:</B> character. See
<A HREF=common.html#param>getting bind parameters</A> for more information how this works. One nice
feature is that the first line retreived from the result set is stored in the parameter cache with
a bind name the same as the column name in lowercase. The example in the <A HREF=common.html#param>getting
bind parameters</A> could have been used directly after executing the line <code>select * from essprc</code>
and get the second row in the table by just using the defaults of the bind dialog.<P>
You can also describe objects returned as in PL/SQL by using either <B>DESC</B> or <B>DESCRIBE</B> and an
object name.<P>
<H2>Exploring the result</H2>
There are five different panes available with information about the executed statements.<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Result</B></TD><TD>
This contains the actual result of the query or describe. For some notes about descriptions
see <A HREF=common.html#describe>this note</A>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Execution plan</B></TD><TD>
The <A HREF=common.html#explain>execution plan</A> of the current statement.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Information
</B></TD><TD>The information available about the current statement in the SGA.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Statistics
</B></TD><TD>The statistics collected when this statement was run. You need to <B>enable
statistics</B> for this to be enabled. To update the statistic view simply change to another tab and change back
to statistics.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Logging
</B></TD><TD>This pane will display the history of the statements you have executed and
their result. It can be sorted up or down depending on <A HREF=worksheet.html#preferences>options</A>.
You can see the statement, it's result and the time (As recorded by the database) when it
was executed. An new statement isn't added to the log until the first row of the query is
returned or the statement has executed, whichever comes first.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<A NAME=preferences><H2>Options</H2>
There are quite a few options available for the worksheet.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/worksheetsetup.png><P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Auto save</B></TD><TD>
If checked the worksheet will always save changes to the editor <B>without asking</B> when the window is closed.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Ask about saving changes</B></TD><TD>
Ask about saving changes to the worksheet when it is modified.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Add log entries at end</B></TD><TD>
If checked new entries in the <B>Logging</B> pane will be added to the end of list, otherwise they will be added at the
top.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Multiple lines in log</B></TD><TD>
If checked the lines in the log will display all the lines of the SQL executed. If not checked only the first line is
displayed, although you can still see all of it in the tooltip or editor if you want to. For more information see
<A HREF=lists.html>using lists</A>.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Parse PL/SQL blocks</B></TD><TD>
If this is checked TOra will parse the text to determine PL/SQL blocks in the editor and execute them as one statement.
If it isn't checked statements are strictly separated by <B>;</B>.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Enable statistics</B></TD><TD>
Indicates if statistics should be enabled or disabled as default when a new worksheet is opened.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Enable timed statistics</B></TD><TD>
Set this to make TOra always enable timed statistics for the sessions that it is collecting statistics for.
Observe that timed statistics will not be disabled after the worksheet is closed. The change is strictly
for the current session though.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
Display number column</B></TD><TD>
Indicate wether or not to display the number column as the first column of the result or suppress it.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>
