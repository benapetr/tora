TOra is licensed under the GPL, however, there is a license
exception in place for all current code allowing Henrik
and Quest software to produce binary releases of TOra for
Windows using the commercial Qt/Windows library.

As soon as the port to Qt/Free for windows or Qt/GPL for 
windows is completed, this license exception will be
removed and future contributions will not include
that exception.
