How to install and run tora

(1) Unzip the tora-zd.XXXX.ming32.zip file to the desktop or some other temporary directory.

(2) Cut/paste the unzipped tora-zd directory into your C:\Program Files directory.

(3) Optionally edit the tora-zd\bin\tora.bat file for the target workstation's
    environment. Normally, the Oracle Instant Client is distributed with this build 
    inside the tora-zd directory and the tora.bat is pre-configured to use this.  
    If another Oracle client library is desired, then this directory can be deleted 
    and the tora.bat file updated accordingly.

    If Instant Client is not distributed with this package, the tora.bat file
    will have to be edited. 

    Alternatively, the Windows environmental variables can be updated instead.
    Go to the Windows Control Panel-->System screen.

(4) If step #3 was skipped, copy the tora-zd\bin\tora.lnk to the desktop, Windows 
    Quick Launch panel or to the user's start menu and click.  Simple.

Enjoy!
