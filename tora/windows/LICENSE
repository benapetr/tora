Notes
=====

This license basically says that if you get paid while using TOra you need to
buy a license. You are however granted a 30 day evaluation period.

If you have registered TOra you can see what kind of license is currently used
on startup in the status bar of the application. Specifically you can see for
how many developers the software is licensed.

Also the per developer license grants you permission to install one license of
TOra on any number of computers as long as only one person is using it. So it's
perfectly ok to install TOra using the same license on both your home computer,
laptop and work computer even if you use all three for work at times, as long
as only one person is using it for commercial used.

You are allowed to redistribute the software in unmodified form on any media
you like. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.
