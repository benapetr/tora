===============================

project-root:
	- READMEs/NEWS ...
	- autogen.sh / configure.ac

config:
	- place to keep some auxiliary scripts from autotools (e.g. missing
          config.guess, config.sub ...)

	- directory for external libraries which are part of the 
	  TOra distribution

        - for CppUnit tests
