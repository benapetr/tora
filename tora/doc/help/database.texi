@subsection Database Settings
@cindex Database Settings

This page of the options contains settings on how to interact with the database.

@image{images/database,15cm}

@table @asis
@item @strong{Autocommit changes}
    If this is set any changes made to the database will be automatically committed as soon as you make them. Use
    this with care, the transaction handling is there for a reason you know.
@item @strong{Reading object cache}
    There are four options of object cache behaviour. @strong{Start read object cache when needed} - will start
    reading it when it is first used. @strong{Read object cache on connect} - TOra will start reading the object
    cache when you start a connection to a database. @strong{Never read object cache until mandatory} - TODO.
    @strong{Never read object cache until mandatory (Will leave some parts of application nonfunctional} - TODO.
    Note that reading this is quite a costly query so you probably shouldn't have this checked if you are in a
    production environment, on a slow connection or not using the object cache. The object cache is mostly used
    for describing tables, the PL/SQL debugger and code completion.
@item @strong{Initial rows to fetch in query}
    This setting indicates how many rows to always fetch from a query when executing it. Observe that you can
    always read more from the individual query just by scrolling down. Check the @strong{All} checkbox to always
    read all available records. Be aware that TOra will interact sluggishly or not at all while reading many lines.
    It will also keep the entire result in memory so checking the @strong{All} box and reading a really large
    table could bring your machine to it's knees.
@item @strong{Initially read in content editor}
    If set to something other than @strong{All} a query will be placed only this number of rows initially from
    Oracle when browsing the content. The reason for this is that Oracle will be under high load if a content
    list is started on a large table. When this value is reached the query will be reread to fetch the rest of
    the values so you as a user will not see any difference.
@item @strong{Maximum size display}
    The maximum width a list column will get automatically regardless of how large the content is. This is so
    you can still see the rest of the columns even if one of the first can contain very large values. You can
    always resize the column by hand afterwards.
@item @strong{Firewall mode.}
    Makes each connection in connection pool to run extra queries (selecting sysdate from dual) at specified
    interval (see "Connection test interval" option). This could be useful if there is a firewall between
    TOra and database and firewall is dropping connections if there is no traffic.
@item @strong{Connection test interval}
    Interval in seconds at which TOra should be sending dummy queries to database (see "Firewall mode").
@item @strong{Indicate empty values as ''.}
    TODO.
@item @strong{Number format.}
    TODO.
@end table

There may also be pages under this for each individual database provider. Currently only Oracle and MySql uses this
feature. That setup looks like this.

@image{images/oracle,13cm}

@table @asis
@item @strong{Checkpoint name}
    This is a checkpoint TOra should use when it is making changes that need to be rolled back. One place where this
    is used is to perform explain plans without filling up the plan table. The name doesn't matter, just make sure
    you don't use this checkpoint name yourself.
@item @strong{Default date format}
    The format that you prefer dates to be displayed. Changing this will require a reconnect to the database before
    it starts to operate. The string should be a standard Oracle date to string conversion specification. For more
    information see the Oracle SQL Reference.
@item @strong{Maximum cursors to keep open}
    TODO.
@item @strong{Max LONG and LOB data length}
    The amount of data to read from LONG, BLOB or CLOB data fields. If you always want all the data to be read
    check the @strong{Unlimited} checkbox to the right. LONG datafields can not be specified as @strong{Unlimited},
    if this is specified 33000 characters are read by default.
@item @strong{Explain plan table}
    The table to use to temporarily store explained execution plans. Use the @strong{Create Table} button to create
    the table if you don't have it.
@item @strong{Keep plans}
    If this is check explained plans are left in the explain plan table. The normal behaviour is to rollback the
    explanation after it is initially read to keep the explain plan table from filling up with old plans.
@end table

@image{images/mysql,13cm}

@table @asis
@item @strong{Possibility to break MySql queries}
    TODO.
@end table
