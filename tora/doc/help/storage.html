<H1>Storage Manager</H1>
This tool provides an easy interface to administrate tablespaces and datafiles.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/storage.png><P>
As you can see in the screenshot above the tool is a list of all the tablespaces available
in the database. The tablespaces can be expanded to display the datafiles they consist of.
There is also one option available to this tool, whether to collect information about how
coalesced the tablespaces are, the coalesced fetching can be very slow on fragmented databases
and if TOra seems to lock itself when you try to start this tool try resetting that option
to not show coalesced info. Using the toolbar you can perform these commands.<P>

When you select a tablespace or datafile the lower part of this tool displays the objects (to the left) and extents (to the right) in that tablespace or file.
A used extent is displayed as green in the extent view if the object it belongs to is not selected in the list to the right. Selecting an item in the list to 
the right will paint it's extents red in the right extent view. Unallocated space is colored whie. Some information about the number of files and extents
are displayed at the top of the extents display. Several datafiles are separated by one line of black in the extent view if a tablespace containing several
files are viewed.
