This tool provides help for writing PL/SQL and SQL queries by allowing a non obtrusive database browser and help lookup.

The template help is implemented as a docked window.

The help browser are divided into two panes. The top pane displays a tree view of the available documentation. The lower is used to display more information about the selected item in the top pane and it's content may differ depending on what is selected.

The top pane is in the default distribution divided into two parts as well. The DB Browser (@pxref{browser,Database Browser}) which lets you explore your connected databases through a tree structure. The second part is a plain tree list of available text documentation. By default only one manual is supplied which contain PL/SQL functions, but an editor is supplied to write more help.

Items in the second part is simply items with a descriptive text associated with them. Selecting the item will bring up the description of it in the information.
