<H1>Using charts</H1>
There are several different chart types in TOra, you can see them all in the screenshot below.<P>
<IMG SRC=images/charts.png BORDER=1><P>
<H2>Piecharts</H2>
This is the most simple chart. If the chart is too small you can open a snapshot of the chart
by doubleclicking it. You can also open a context menu by rightclicking it. In the context menu
you can choose to print the chart as well and open a snapshot in a new window.<P>
<H2>Linecharts & barcharts</H2>
These two charts work in the same way. The difference is that in a barchart the values are added
on top of each other so you can easily see the sum of all values.<P>
You can zoom a part of a chart by leftclicking it and dragging a selection. If a chart is currently
zoomed the word <B>Zoom</B> is printed in the upper left corner. You can remove the zooming by right
clicking on the chart.<P>
The snapshot feature, context menu and printing works the same for these charts as for the piechart.
In the context menu you have an additional item though that is <B>Properties</B>.<P>
