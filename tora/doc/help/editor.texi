      This list contains different parts of the SQL syntax. You can change the color used for the element by selecting the item in this list and then pressing the Pick button to select a color. The current color of the currently selected item in the list is displayed just to the left of the Pick button.

The available elements are as follows.
 @multitable @columnfractions .3 .7
 @item @strong{Background} @tab The normal background color for text.
 @item @strong{Comment}	@tab An SQL comment. Currently this only includes -- comments, not rem comments.

 At the bottom of this dialog is a text field that displays en example of the current setting.

@item @strong{Syntax highlighting}
      Use this to control whether you want syntax highlighting or not. Observe that without syntax highlighting you will not see the indications for errors and current lines in the PL/SQL editor.	
@item @strong{Use maximum text width mark}
      TODO.
@item @strong{Keyword upper}
      Check this box to convert all keywords to uppercase before displaying them. The text itself is not changed so resetting this not changed and the text sent to the database still contain lowercase letters. This setting is disabled if you do not have a monospaced font selected.	
@item @strong{Code completion}
      Check this box to enable code completion in SQL editors.	
@item @strong{Editor shortcuts (TAB replacement)}

@item @strong{Sort completion rows}
      If checked the completion alternatives are sorted in alphabetical order, otherwise they are in the same order as in the source.

      When inserting a new line indent it to the same level as the previous one.

      TODO.
@item @strong{Use only spaces when indenting}
      TODO.
@item @strong{Static checker}
      Specifies static checker to be used. This configuration option should contain %1 which will be replaced with a filename (with full path) containing code to be checked. For example:
      @example
perl /usr/bin/staticChecker.pl --output=TORA --file=%1
      @end example
@end table
There may also be pages under this for each individual database provider. Currently only Oracle uses this feature. That setup looks like this.
