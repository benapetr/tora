===============================================
Please write templates and send them to me so I can include them in the
distribution. To write templates go to "Edit|Options|SQL Templates|Edit".
Check the AVG function for an example of what I had in mind would be
usefull. Remember you can't just copy the Oracle documentation (Although
you can base it on that) since that is copyrighted by Oracle.
