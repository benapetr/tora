Supplying patches to TOra
=========================
Even though TOra is an open source GPL project it is also a commercial
project for the Windows platform. Both these projects are compiled
from the same codebase. Therefore any patches that are to be accepted
by me into the project must adhere to one of the following three
conditions.

1. The code given is public domain without any associated copyright.

2. The copyright of the code given is assigned to Underscore AB.

3. The code is licensed under LGPL and part of a separate library.

Since most patches are a few lines of code which are part of files
which have an assigned copyright at the top of the files if nothing
else is specified the second alternative is assumed (Because the files
in question does have a copyright at the top of them and nobody
bothered changing them).
