Binary/Installable builds for TOra are built by volunteers. If you are
willing to build binaries for a platform not listed here (or wish to
take over building binaries for a listed platform), please send a note
to tora-develop list after subscribing to it.

With autoconf builds, it is best to specify "CXXFLAGS=-O2" to avoid 
adding the debug symbols to the code by default.
