OCI:
	Empty strings seem to be indicated as NULL values from the OCI call. (This seems to be an
	Oracle bug since other programs have the same problem)

OTL:
	Doesn't seem to handle object types and some other types (Like ROWID for instance).

Toolbars:
	When in KDE and using a gradient style (Like KDE highcolor for instance) backgrounds of
	toolbuttons and labels in the toolbar doesn't have the correct background. This is due
	to a KDE bug I think. Other people on the KDE mailinglist seem to have experienced similar
	difficulties.

toDebug:
	Seems a recompiled object is invalidated the first time it is executed in the target
	session. Just start again and you should be fine.

Qt:
	Some layouts seem to expand far beyond the content of the screen until you resize it.
	The toResultContent never seem to receive focus as it should, how should this be fixes?

gcc-2.96:
	Seems really bad at handling exceptions, won't work with TOra.

toNoBlockQuery:
	Can't abort execution on queries when using TO_QTHREAD.

toTemplate:
	Can't seem to delete entries from the template lists.

toResultCols:
	Doesn't follow synonyms for comments and statistics.
