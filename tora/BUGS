OCI:
	Empty strings seem to be indicated as NULL values from the OCI call. (This seems to be an Oracle bug since other programs have same problem)

toDebug:
	Seems a recompiled object seems invalidated the first time it is executed in the target
	session.

Qt:
	Some layouts seem to expand far beyond the content of the screen until you resize it.
	The toResultContent never seem to receive focus as it should, how should this be fixes?
