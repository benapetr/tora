OCI:
	Empty strings seem to be indicated as NULL values from the OCI call. (This seems to be an
	Oracle bug since other programs have the same problem)

OTL:
	Doesn't seem to handle object types and some other types (Like ROWID for instance).

toDebug:
	Seems a recompiled object is invalidated the first time it is executed in the target
	session. Just start again and you should be fine.

Qt:
	Some layouts seem to expand far beyond the content of the screen until you resize it.
	The toResultContent never seem to receive focus as it should, how should this be fixes?
