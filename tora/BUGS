OCI:
	Empty strings seem to be indicated as NULL values from the OCI call. (This seems to be an
	Oracle bug since other programs have the same problem)

Toolbars:
	When in KDE and using a gradient style (Like KDE highcolor for instance) backgrounds of
	toolbuttons and labels in the toolbar doesn't have the correct background. This is due
	to a KDE bug I think. Other people on the KDE mailinglist seem to have experienced similar
	difficulties.

Qt:
	The toResultContent never seem to receive focus as it should, how should this be fixes?
	There are some redraw problems with QListItems that don't draw left justified text.

toMain:
	Traversing the menues using keys will disable some file/edit entries that should be
	enabled.

toResultContent:
	Doesn't display multiline data correctly.
	Doesn't sort numbers numerically.
	Deleting rows doesn't seem to work.

toTemplate:
	Doesn't seem to remember more than one template file.

toGetToken:
	Doesn't handle comments when going backwards.

toHighlightedText:
	Doesn't handle quoted tablenames on code completion.

toMysqlConnection:
	Doesn't handle other locales than latin1 correctly.

toSQLEdit:
	Problems with the left pane when adding or deleting items.
