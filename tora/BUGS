OCI:
	Empty strings seem to be indicated as NULL values from the OCI call. (This seems to be an
	Oracle bug since other programs have the same problem)

Toolbars:
	When in KDE and using a gradient style (Like KDE highcolor for instance) backgrounds of
	toolbuttons and labels in the toolbar doesn't have the correct background. This is due
	to a KDE bug I think. Other people on the KDE mailinglist seem to have experienced similar
	difficulties.

Qt:
	The toResultContent never seem to receive focus as it should, how should this be fixes?
	There are some redraw problems with QListItems that don't draw left justified text.

gcc-2.96:
	Seems really bad at handling exceptions, won't work with TOra.

toMain:
	Traversing the menues using keys will disable some file/edit entries that should be
	enabled.

toResultCols:
	Doesn't follow synonyms for comments and statistics.

toResultContent:
	Doesn't display multiline data correctly.
	Doesn't sort numbers numerically.

toResultStat:
	Statistics for parallel servers will only show up as long as the parallel query is actually
	running.

Unknown:
	Crashes when starting without any database providers.
