OCI:
	Empty strings seem to be indicated as NULL values from the OCI call. (This seems to be an
	Oracle bug since other programs have the same problem)

Toolbars:
	When in KDE and using a gradient style (Like KDE highcolor for instance) backgrounds of
	toolbuttons and labels in the toolbar doesn't have the correct background. This is due
	to a KDE bug I think. Other people on the KDE mailinglist seem to have experienced similar
	difficulties.

Qt:
	Looses titlebar on resulution change, seems to be a Qt bug.
	When using antialiased text doesn't draw left axis legend correctly in charts.

toResultContent:
	Doesn't display multiline data correctly.
	Doesn't sort numbers numerically.

toGetToken:
	Doesn't handle comments when going backwards.

toMysqlConnection:
	Doesn't handle other locales than latin1 correctly.

otl:
	Sometimes looses open cursors when cancelling and multiple queries are running.

toParamGet:
	Should ignore ':' within comments.
