OCI:
	Empty strings seem to be indicated as NULL values from the OCI call. (This seems to be an
	Oracle bug since other programs have the same problem)

Toolbars:
	When in KDE and using a gradient style (Like KDE highcolor for instance) backgrounds of
	toolbuttons and labels in the toolbar doesn't have the correct background. This is due
	to a KDE bug I think. Other people on the KDE mailinglist seem to have experienced similar
	difficulties.

Qt:
	The toResultContent never seem to receive focus as it should, how should this be fixes?
	There are some redraw problems with QListItems that don't draw left justified text.
	Looses titlebar on resulution change, seems to be a Qt bug.
	When using antialiased text doesn't draw left axis legend correctly in charts.

toResultContent:
	Doesn't display multiline data correctly.
	Doesn't sort numbers numerically.

toGetToken:
	Doesn't handle comments when going backwards.

toMysqlConnection:
	Doesn't handle other locales than latin1 correctly.

toWorksheet:
	Doesn't handle multiline comment /* */ correctly.

toConnection:
	In windows canceling the object reading doesn't work for some reason.

toStorage:
	Create a new tablespace doesn't work (Does alter instead of create).

toNoBlockQuery:
	Seems to block sometimes when executing a query.
